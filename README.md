# Second Brain

A privacy-focused personal AI assistant that manages calendar, notes, and tasks through natural language via SimpleX Chat. All processing occurs on self-hosted infrastructure without cloud dependencies.

## Credits & Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Nate's Second Brain system](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/grab-the-system-that-closes-open), which uses Zapier, Notion, and Slack to create a powerful thought capture system.

**Nate's Original Design:**
- 3 Zapier automations, 5 Notion databases, 1 Slack channel
- The Core Loop:
  1. Capture a thought in Slack (5 seconds)
  2. Zapier sends it to Claude/ChatGPT for classification
  3. AI returns structured JSON with category, fields, and confidence
  4. Zapier routes it to the correct Notion database
  5. Zapier replies in Slack confirming what it did
  6. Daily/weekly digests surface what matters

**This project adapts that concept for privacy-conscious self-hosters:**

| Nate's Stack | This Project | Benefit |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Slack | SimpleX Chat | End-to-end encrypted, no metadata |
| Zapier | n8n | Self-hosted, no cloud dependency |
| Notion | Obsidian API | Local markdown files, full ownership |
| Cloud AI | Your choice | Use local LLMs or cloud APIs |

Same powerful workflow, but everything runs on your own hardware.

## Features

### Calendar Management

| Command | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Query today | "what's on my calendar today?" |
| Query tomorrow | "tell me my schedule tomorrow" |
| Query specific date | "what's on the 9th Jan?" |
| Query this week | "what's on this week?" |
| Add event | "add meeting at 3pm tomorrow" |
| Add multiple | "add lunch at 1pm and meeting at 3pm" |
| Delete event | "cancel my 3pm meeting tomorrow" |

### Notes Management (Obsidian)

| Database | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| People | Contact info | "add to Nikki she has good eye for photography" |
| Projects | Multi-step goals | "new project: Second Brain mobile app" |
| Ideas | Insights | "idea: AI-powered email sorter" |
| Admin | Tasks/todos | "task: renew passport by March" |
| Inbox Log | Audit trail | (automatic) |

### Delete with Confirmation

```
User: "delete photography"
System: "🔍 Found 3 matches:
         1. 👤 "Nikki" in people
         2. 💡 "photography NFT project" in ideas
         Reply with number (1-3) to delete, or 'cancel'."
User: "2"
System: "✅ Deleted: photography NFT project from ideas"
```

### Fix Misclassified Entries

When the AI isn't sure where something belongs, it goes to "Needs Review":

```
User: "fix: people"   → Moves last review item to People database
User: "fix: project"  → Moves last review item to Projects database
```
